# Step 1: Break into Groups (5-6 students per group)
Each group will focus on a different aspect or technology within nuclear power. Here are a few possible topics:

Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)
Next-Generation Fission (e.g., Fast Breeder Reactors, Molten Salt Reactors)
Nuclear Fusion (e.g., ITER, Tokamaks)
Nuclear Waste Management and Recycling (e.g., Fuel Reprocessing)
Nuclear Energy Economics and Cost Comparisons (e.g., comparing the cost per kWh of nuclear with other energy sources like solar, wind, and coal)

# Step 2: Research (15-20 minutes)

Each group spends 15-20 minutes conducting brief research on their assigned nuclear technology. They should focus on the current state of the technology, its potential benefits, challenges, and scalability.
As part of the research, they’ll perform back-of-the-envelope calculations. For example:
SMR Group: Estimate how many SMRs would be needed to replace a coal plant (consider capacity factor, typical output of an SMR, etc.).
Fusion Group: Calculate the energy output of a theoretical fusion reactor and compare it to current fission reactors.
Waste Management Group: Estimate the amount of nuclear waste produced by a 1 GW nuclear power plant over its lifetime, and compare it to the waste produced by coal plants.
Suggested Research Resources:

Academic papers and articles on the specific technology.
Databases like the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) or World Nuclear Association.
Publicly available data from existing nuclear power plants (capacity, output, costs, etc.).

# Step 3: Calculation Questions (integrated with research)
Here are some guiding quantitative questions for each group:

## SMR Group:
What is the output of an SMR compared to a conventional reactor? How many would be needed to replace a typical coal plant (e.g., 1 GW capacity)?
How long would it take to deploy X number of SMRs?
How does the cost per kWh compare to traditional energy sources?
## Next-Gen Fission Group:
What is the fuel efficiency (burn-up rate) compared to traditional reactors? How does it affect waste production?
How much fuel is saved per year with advanced reactors vs. traditional reactors?
## Fusion Group:
How much energy can a future fusion reactor produce? What’s the theoretical capacity factor of fusion?
How does the energy density of fusion fuel (e.g., deuterium) compare to that of uranium or fossil fuels?
## Nuclear Waste Group:
How much high-level waste is produced by a typical reactor over 40 years?
What is the half-life of common waste isotopes, and how does this factor into long-term storage?
## Economics Group:
What is the cost of building and maintaining a nuclear power plant vs. solar and wind farms?
How do decommissioning costs compare across energy types?

# Step 4: Group Presentations (15-20 minutes total)
Each group presents their findings and back-of-the-envelope calculations. Focus on:

Key findings from their research (e.g., advantages and disadvantages of their nuclear technology).
Results of their calculations (e.g., how many SMRs to replace coal plants, cost differences between fusion and fission, etc.).
Whether they think their technology is viable as part of the global climate solution.

# Step 5: Full-Class Discussion (10-15 minutes)
After presentations, open the floor for a class-wide discussion where:

Students compare and contrast the technologies they researched.
Discuss which technology seems most viable in terms of scaling up, costs, safety, etc.
Reflect on any challenges that came up during their calculations (e.g., unknown data, assumptions they had to make).
