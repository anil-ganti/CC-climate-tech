## Final Group Project
Your group will be asked to develop a pitch deck for a new climate technology solution which addresses the emissions associated with land-use and agriculture, two sectors we really don't have great answers for at the moment. Solutions could range from a new aquaponics farm, to a new way to remove and store atmospheric carbon on land. We're not necessarily asking for *new, new* technology here, but I want you to dive deep into something you're interested in and make a case for it and *quantify the impact*. I will provide a few reports of places to look.

These should be technology-only solutions (no policies, please!) which you are trying to make competitive in a market. It's okay to have a "green premium", but make an argument for why someone might pay that initially and how it might come down over time. You may assume that there is a robust voluntary carbon market (VCM) which we will talk more about next week. This means that there are companies (large tech companies, see [Frontier buyers club](https://frontierclimate.com/) or [Microsoft Carbon Removal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/sustainability/carbon-removal-program)) who are willing to pay a price for a ton of carbon removed from the atmosphere. It has to be a true removal, meaning, the LCA needs to "work out" such that you are not emitting more carbon than you removed in the process.

### Learning Objectives
If successful students will demonstrate the ability to:

- support their arguments with "gut-check" back-of-the-envelope calculations using dimensional analysis
- clearly lay out any assumptions they are making, and be able to support those assumptions
- Use what you've learned about TEA, LCA, etc in your quantitative analysis
- appropriately synthesize and build upon data / analyses from trusted sources
- quantify potential climate impacts (GHG emission reductions or GHG removal) and other potential "co-benefits"

### Deliverable
15 minute presentation + 5 min for questions
