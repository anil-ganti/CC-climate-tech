# Group Assignment: Analyzing Net-Zero Pathways for America (Princeton Report)
Each group will do a "deep dive" on one of the six pillars (see Slide 17 of the [Summary Slides](https://netzeroamerica.princeton.edu/img/Princeton%20NZA%20FINAL%20REPORT%20SUMMARY%20(29Oct2021).pdf). Groups will answer a common set of questions and share their findings in a 10-minute presentation plus 5 minutes for questions.

## Learning Objectives:
Students will gain an understanding of the technical, economic, social and policy considerations that are involved in creating a net-zero economy.

## Assignment
For your assigned pillar, you will be making a set of slides which answers the set of questions below. You will have 15 minutes in total for your presentation, I suggest 12 minutes for presenting and 3 minutes for questions.

### Reading
Take 20 minutes looking through slides 5 - 13 of the [Princeton Net-Zero America Report Summary](https://netzeroamerica.princeton.edu/img/Princeton%20NZA%20FINAL%20REPORT%20SUMMARY%20(29Oct2021).pdf). This will be necessary for understanding the questions.

### Question 1: Define the pillar (1 slide)
In your own words and on one slide introduce the pillar you have looked at. How much of the total emissions does this pillar address? In the Heilmeyer catechism, this is the "how is it done today" question.

### Question 2: Give a quantitative summary of how emissions will be reduced (1-2 slides)
Find the appropriate summary graphic in the report and be prepared to explain, in your own words, how emissions reductions associated with this pillar will be achieved in the various scenarios presented.

### Question 3: Enabling technologies (1-2 slides)
What are the key enabling technologies that make the emissions reductions in this pillar possible? In what ways are they similar or different across the 5 scenarios? How ready would you say these technologies to be deployed at scale? Justify. Are there any potential disruptive technologies on the horizon in this area that would impact the findings of this report?

### Question 4: Economic factors (1-2 slides)
How does economics come into play? What are the effects on end-consumers and how does this differ across the scenarios? Show 1-2 key figures from the report that make these points.

### Question 5: Policy factors
How is this pillar affected by policy? Are there policies that could accelerate pillar? Hinder it? Answering this question may require research outside of the NZA report because the report was written in 2021.

### Question 6: Social factors
What about consumer behavior / other social factors? Across the various scenarios does this pillar require a societal change? If so, in what ways? Are there ways to "design around" the need for societal change in this pillar?

## Evaluation

The answer to each question will be scored 1 - 5, as well as a score for overall presentation quality and Q&A handling.
| **Score** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                           |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **5**     | The group provides a complete, clear, and insightful response. Explanations are thorough and supported by evidence from the report or external research where applicable.    |
| **4**     | The group provides a mostly complete response with good clarity. Explanations are solid but may lack depth in some areas or minor evidence gaps.                           |
| **3**     | The group addresses the question but with limited detail or clarity. Some parts of the explanation are incomplete or lack clear evidence from the report or research.       |
| **2**     | The group provides a partial response. Key details or evidence are missing, and the explanation is difficult to follow or unclear in significant ways.                     |
| **1**     | The group provides little to no meaningful response. The explanation is superficial, incorrect, or fails to address the question adequately.                               |
