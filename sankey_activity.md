# Guided Activity: Interpreting Global Energy, Carbon, and Water Sankey Diagrams

## Objective
Students will analyze global Sankey diagrams related to energy, carbon, and water flows, focusing on reflecting on their prior assumptions and understanding the broader climate problem. They will engage in open-ended questions that encourage critical thinking, helping to develop a 30,000-foot view of the problem.

## Open-Ended Guiding Questions for Sankey Diagram Analysis

### 1. Energy Sankey Diagram (e.g., IEA Global Energy Flow)
- **Which of the end-uses of energy surprised you the most and why?**  
  What assumptions did you have about energy usage that this diagram confirmed or challenged?

- **Where do you see the largest inefficiencies, and how did this align with your expectations?**  
  Did you expect more energy losses in certain sectors, and why might this be the case?

- **What energy sources were you expecting to see as dominant, and how does the reality compare?**  
  Were there any energy sources that were more or less significant than you thought? What might be contributing to this difference?

- **If you had to prioritize one area for improvement based on the diagram, where would it be and why?**  
  How do your priorities compare to the actual flows shown in the diagram?

---

### 2. Carbon Sankey Diagram (e.g., IPCC Global Carbon Flow)
- **Which carbon-emitting sector stood out to you, and why?**  
  Did you expect certain sectors (e.g., transportation, industry) to be larger contributors to emissions? What informed that expectation?

- **What part of the carbon cycle surprised you in terms of natural sinks or emissions?**  
  How did your prior understanding of how much carbon is absorbed by natural systems (e.g., oceans, forests) compare with the diagram?

- **Where do you think the greatest opportunity for carbon reduction lies based on this diagram?**  
  Does this align with the areas you would have guessed prior to seeing the diagram?

- **How does the scale of human carbon emissions compare with natural carbon flows in your mind?**  
  Did the diagram confirm or challenge your perception of human impact?

---

### 3. Water Sankey Diagram (e.g., Global Water Footprint)
- **Which water uses or sectors were the most surprising in terms of their consumption?**  
  How did this compare with your assumptions about where most water is used globally?

- **What inefficiencies or areas of water waste did you not expect?**  
  Were there any sectors or uses of water that you thought would be more efficient?

- **How does water availability and usage align with energy or food systems in ways you didnâ€™t expect?**  
  What assumptions did you have about the connection between water use and other systems, and how does the diagram challenge or reinforce them?

- **Which part of the diagram made you think differently about the global water problem?**  
  Did this diagram change your thinking on where the most urgent water-related issues lie?

---

## Additional Discussion Prompts (for class-wide reflection)
- **Were there any common threads across the diagrams that surprised you?**  
  Did you expect certain sectors or systems to dominate across energy, carbon, and water flows, and how does the reality compare?

- **What assumptions did you have coming into this exercise that were most challenged by the evidence in the diagrams?**  
  Which parts of your understanding felt most in need of revision after seeing the data?

- **How do your personal values or concerns (e.g., energy independence, sustainability, water scarcity) align with what the diagrams are showing?**  
  Did this activity shift how you prioritize different aspects of the climate problem?

- **What areas of technology or policy do you think would have the greatest impact based on what you've learned today?**  
  Did your views on potential solutions or innovations shift based on the evidence?

## Conclusion
This activity encourages students to reflect on their prior assumptions about energy, carbon, and water systems while analyzing real-world data. The open-ended nature of the questions will stimulate critical thinking and set the stage for deeper exploration of climate solutions.
