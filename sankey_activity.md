# Assignment: Interpreting Global Energy, Carbon, and Water Sankey Diagrams

## Learning Objectives
Students will learn to critically read Sankey diagrams, which are important tools for getting a quick, overview of energy / carbon / water flows. Students will practice dimensional analysis and demonstrate they understand how to make a quick, argument using only a Sankey diagram and some 1st order approximations. Finally, this exercise will serve as a "level-setting" of what are the large outstanding problems in getting to net-zero carbon emissions.


### Question 1 - Learning to Read and Use a Sankey Diagram (70%)
- Open [OtherLab Super Sankey for US Energy](http://www.departmentof.energy/) and get your bearings. Play around with the UI and learn to use the control
  
- What are the units of the flows in this chart? Convert this to SI units and watt-hours (1 ABC unit = X Joules = Y Wh)

- What do the first three columns represent? What the the connections between these columsn represent?
  
- Find the column which has the residential energy usage by fuel type. How much natural gas is used in residential? If we were to "electrify" this flow (replace using natural gas with electirity), how much additional electrical energy would we need to generate in watt-hours assuming natural gas appliances and electrical appliances are equally efficient?
  
- Assume an average solar panel in an average location in the US produces 300 Watts per square meter per day for 12 hours a day on average. How many square meters of solar panels would be needed? Type this answer into Wolfram Alpha as "Z square meters" and scroll down to the comparisons. Write in your favorite comparison.

- Open the 2022 Carbon Sankey diagram in [Energy, Carbon, Water Sankey diagrams](https://flowcharts.llnl.gov/commodities). If natural gas is replaced in residences with carbon-free electricity, what are the emission reductions (in what units)?

### Question 2 - Using the Sankey diagram to find opportunities (15%)
Now that we understand what we are looking at and how to use it, let's use this to think strategically.

- Look at the fourth column. What are the two largest energy-using sectors? Pick one of these to drill down into and click on it, which should highlight all the "downstream" flows.

- Follow the flows all the way to the 7th column. Pick one of these end-uses larger than 1 quad, click on it, then at the top click the "outgoing value" tab to see the breakdown. Record and explain the numbers you found. This may require some Googling if you don't understand the breakdown.

- Can you think of ways to either reduce the flow you've picked or decarbonize this flow? Try doing a Google search on this.

### Question 3 - Explore! (10%)
Finally, now that we know how to read and use a Sankey, take a bit more time to look around at the large flows and answer these questions:

- Which end-use of energy surprised you the most in terms of its magnitude and why?

- Find two end-uses (columns 4 and beyond) for which you are not aware of any technology solutions to decarbonization. Try a Google search on these and record what comes up. Are there companies working on this, or is this a wide-open space?

### Question 4 - 

Read this accompanying blog post from OtherLab [THE GREEN NEW DEAL: THE ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITY IN SHOOTING FOR THE MOON.](https://www.otherlab.com/blog-posts/the-green-new-deal-the-enormous-opportunity-in-shooting-for-the-moon)

- Explain why massive electrification of transportation is a big win, even if we don't change our electricity generation mix. Do your own Google search on efficiencies to explain this.
