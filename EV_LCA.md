# Lifecycle Analysis of Electric Vehicles (EVs)

## Learning Objectives
Students will learn how rigorous accounting is needed when looking at a technologies emissions and environmental footprint. Students will learn the different components that make up a product's total carbon footprint.

## Question 1 - Understanding stages of LCA
Download and open the report [Electric vehicles from life cycle and circular economy perspectives](https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/electric-vehicles-from-life-cycle).

- Figure 1.2 shows 6 boxes, or stages, where emissions and environmental impact are to be assessed. List them. Describe each in a sentence or two in the context of EVs.
