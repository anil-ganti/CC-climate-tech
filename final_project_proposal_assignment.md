## Proposal Assignment

Submit a no more than 1-page document with 2-3 potential project ideas. Also include a half-page documenting your group's ideation and selection process.

Below is a potential guide for your group to ideate and down-select your project ideas. Whatever your process is, you will be asked to document it and submit that documentation.


## Project Proposal Working Session Guide

### **1. Ideation Phase (45 minutes)**

#### Warm-Up Exercise (10 minutes)
- Each group member writes down **3-5 broad ideas** for a climate tech solution.
- Prompts for brainstorming:
  - What are current gaps in climate solutions that technology could fill?
  - Think about everyday problems related to energy, waste, transportation, or food.
  - What emerging technologies could be applied to climate challenges?
  - What small behavioral changes, incentivized through tech, could make a big impact?
- Example categories to spark ideas:
  - Consumer apps (e.g., behavior change, gamification of emissions reduction)
  - Hardware (e.g., carbon removal, energy storage, alternative fuels)
  - Systems (e.g., grid optimization, logistics efficiency, urban planning)

#### Idea Sharing and Grouping (15 minutes)
- Each member shares their ideas with the group.
- Cluster similar ideas and group them into **themes** (e.g., transportation solutions, agricultural innovations, etc.).

#### Select Themes to Explore (20 minutes)
- As a group, pick **2-3 themes** that resonate most.
- For each theme, briefly discuss:
  - Why is this theme interesting or important?
  - What makes it a potential climate tech solution?

### **2. Exploration Phase (1 hour)**

#### Deep Dive into Themes (30 minutes)
For each selected theme, discuss the following questions:
- **What’s the problem?**
  - What is the specific climate problem this solution addresses?
  - How big is the problem (e.g., emissions reduction potential, scalability)?
- **How would the solution work?**
  - What is the core mechanism or technology behind the solution?
  - Are there any existing technologies or methods it builds on?
- **What’s the climate impact?**
  - Could this reduce emissions, remove CO₂, or increase resilience?
  - Is there data or evidence to support its effectiveness?
- **What’s the feasibility?**
  - How realistic is it to implement (technical, economic, and social barriers)?
  - Who would be the main users or stakeholders?

#### Narrow Down to 2-3  Ideas (30 minutes)
- For each theme, brainstorm specific project ideas and select **1-3** that seem most promising.
- Sketch a **1-2 sentence summary** for each idea.

---

### **3. Convergence Phase (45 minutes)**

#### Draft the 1-Pager (30 minutes)
For each selected idea, include:
- **Name of the Solution**: A concise and catchy name.
- **Problem Statement**: What is the climate problem this solution addresses?
- **Proposed Solution**: How does it work? What makes it unique?
- **Potential Climate Impact**: What’s the projected benefit (qualitative or quantitative)?
- **Feasibility Considerations**: What challenges might arise?


## Evaluation

Proposals evaluated for completeness and thoughtful-ness. Process documents will be graded for completeness.
