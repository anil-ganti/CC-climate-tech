# Group Activity: Designing Zero-Emissions Agricultural Systems

## Objective
Each group will design a zero-emissions or highly decarbonized agricultural system based on one of the topics below. Your goal is to create a system that addresses key emissions sources in agriculture, integrates technologies, and optimizes for sustainability. Each group will present a conceptual design along with key calculations or analyses to support the feasibility of the system.

## Instructions
1. Select one of the topics below for your system design.
2. Use a **systems engineering approach** to lay out the major components and subsystems. Consider inputs (e.g., water, energy, nutrients), outputs (e.g., food, carbon emissions, waste), and how they interact.
3. Perform a **basic analysis** or calculation to support your design (e.g., how much CO₂ is captured, energy required, water usage).
4. Identify **key challenges** to your system’s implementation (technological, economic, or environmental) and propose ways to overcome them.
5. Present a brief overview of your design (conceptual diagrams encouraged) and analysis to the class.
