Day 1 commentary:
- primarily here to drawdown GHGs which increase net-radiative forcing. Out-of-scope issues:
    - climate resilience, adaptation
    - habitat and biodiversity loss
    - other environmental pollutants (microplastics, groundwater pollution, etc.)
- need to address elephant in the room, incoming administration
    - number of people committed to climate action hasn't reduced
    - 4 years of business as usual makes things harder but can be overcome

- why energy geopolitics are back, how they play a factor, how we need to learn to roll with this
- why this course is part engineering part economics. energy is a commodity made cheap by large cap-ex investments. climate tech lives and dies by unit economics
- despite this, why we should still be pursuing far-reaching technologies
