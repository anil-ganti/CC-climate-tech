# Reducing Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) Using Technology

Your task is to propose a **technology-only** solution to reduce vehicle miles traveled (VMT). You should identify a specific portion of VMT that your technology targets (e.g., commuting, long-distance travel, urban vs. rural travel) and estimate the impact of your solution on reducing VMT. Be specific about how the technology works, why you chose to address that portion of VMT, and what the total reduction in miles could be.


## Learning Objectives
- Apply creative thinking and engineering to a climate relevant problem
- Analytically breakdown a large emissions sectors into smaller, more manageable segments
- Apply quantitative thinking to new technology ideas


## Assignment Breakdown

### Step 1: Choose a Specific VMT Segment
- **Task:** Identify the specific portion of personal VMT that your idea will address. Examples include:
  - Commuting to work (daily VMT in urban/suburban areas)
  - Long-distance family or recreational trips
  - Short, local trips for errands and shopping
  - Ride-hailing services (Uber/Lyft-type miles)
  - Freight / movement of goods

- **Guiding Questions:**
  - Why did you choose this segment of VMT? Is it a major contributor to total VMT in the region you’re targeting?
  - What makes this portion of VMT particularly suited to technology-based reductions?

### Step 2: Propose Your Tech-Only Solution
- **Task:** Describe a specific technology or technological innovation that could significantly reduce VMT in your chosen segment. **Avoid policy-based solutions** (e.g., taxes, incentives, infrastructure changes), focusing entirely on technology.
  - Examples of potential technologies:
    - Autonomous vehicle (AV) ridesharing platforms that optimize routes and reduce individual trips.
    - A mobile app that coordinates efficient carpooling among commuters using real-time data and AI.
    - Virtual reality (VR) meetings that reduce the need for business travel.
    - E-bike and e-scooter sharing systems designed to replace short personal vehicle trips.

- **Guiding Questions:**
  - How does this technology directly reduce the number of vehicle miles traveled?
  - How is the technology scalable, and what user behaviors does it rely on to succeed?
  - What potential barriers or adoption challenges might your solution face?

### Step 3: Estimate the Impact on VMT
- **Task:** Estimate how much of the total personal VMT in your chosen segment could be reduced using your technology. You should use **back-of-the-envelope calculations** to provide a rough estimate of the impact.

- **Steps for Estimation:**
  1. **Identify the baseline VMT for your target segment** (e.g., commuting accounts for X% of total VMT).
  2. **Estimate the adoption rate** of your technology over a specific time period (e.g., in 5 years, 10% of commuters use the new app).
  3. **Calculate the potential reduction in miles** based on this adoption rate and the percentage of VMT that could be replaced (e.g., each carpool reduces 2 trips per day).
  4. **Present a final VMT reduction figure** based on the above assumptions.

- **Guiding Questions:**
  - What percentage of total personal VMT could your technology reduce?
  - How realistic are your assumptions about adoption rates and effectiveness?
  - Could this solution be scaled to other regions or demographics?

### Step 4: Present Your Findings
- **Task:** Summarize your proposed solution, the specific VMT segment it addresses, and your estimated impact. Present your findings in a brief written report (1-2 pages) or a short presentation (5-7 minutes), depending on the assignment format.

- **Required Elements:**
  - **Technology Overview:** A clear description of how the technology works.
  - **VMT Segment:** Explanation of the portion of VMT being addressed.
  - **Impact Estimation:** Your calculations showing how much VMT could be reduced.
  - **Discussion:** A brief discussion on the feasibility of your idea and any potential barriers to adoption.

## Examples of Calculations
Here are a couple of examples of how students might approach the calculations:

1. **Carpooling App for Commuters:**
   - **Assumption:** Commuting accounts for 30% of total personal VMT in the region.
   - **Adoption Rate:** Estimate that 10% of commuters adopt the app in 5 years.
   - **VMT Reduction:** Each carpool reduces VMT by 50% for the individuals involved (1 car instead of 2).
   - **Calculation:** If the average commuter travels 30 miles per day and 10% of commuters use the app, the total reduction could be calculated as:
     ```
     Total VMT reduction = (Number of commuters × 30 miles/day × 0.10 adoption rate) × 0.50 VMT reduction factor
     ```

2. **Virtual Reality for Business Meetings:**
   - **Assumption:** Business travel accounts for 5% of personal VMT.
   - **Adoption Rate:** Assume 25% of business meetings are replaced by VR by 2030.
   - **VMT Reduction:** Estimate the average business trip is 300 miles round-trip.
   - **Calculation:** Estimate the total VMT avoided by VR meetings based on the frequency and average distance of trips:
     ```
     Total VMT reduction = Number of trips replaced × 300 miles
     ```

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Creativity:** How innovative is the proposed technology?
- **Feasibility:** Does the idea seem plausible based on current or emerging technology?
- **Impact:** How well does the student justify the estimated impact on VMT?
- **Clarity:** Is the explanation clear, with well-reasoned arguments and calculations?
