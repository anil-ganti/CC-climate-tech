# Reducing Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) Using Technology

The goal of this assignment is to look at technology trends either in or adjacent to transportation and understand their potential climate relevance.


## Learning Objectives
- We want to "skate to where the puck is going". This is an exercise in forward thinking and learning to strategize about how to think about climate in a broader market / technology context.
- Apply creative thinking and engineering to a climate relevant problem
- Apply quantitative thinking to new technology ideas


## Transportation areas
- Wireless EV charging
- Autonomous long-haul trucking
- Last-mile drone delivery
- Vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) personal aircraft
- Micro-mobility services
- Shared autonomous vehicles in urban areas
- Carbon fiber / vehicle lightweighting
- Battery swapping or battery circularity
- Propose your own!


## Assignment

### Question 1: Introduce the technology (1-2 slides)
Use the Heilmeyer catechism to say what the technology is, how it was previously done, and what impact this could have. In term of impact, start qualitative, we will go into quantitative impacts later.

### Question 2: Climate relevance (2 slides)
How might this technology affect transportation emissions? Dedicate one slide to how this area could lead to more emissions. Dedicate another slide to how it might actually reduce emisssions. Be quantitative if possible.

### Question 3: Ways to leverage the technology for emissions reductions (2-3 slides)
Time to get creative. Assuming this technology is succesful, how can we leverage it to maximize potential emissions reductions. Propose one policy solution and one technology-only solution. Quantitatively estimate how much impact these ideas could have.


### Question 4: Barriers to Adoption and Mitigation Strategies (1-2 slides)
- What are the key **barriers to adoption** of this technology? Consider technical, economic, social, or infrastructure-related barriers.
- For each barrier, propose one strategy to **mitigate** or overcome it. Be specific and realistic about what needs to change.


### Question 5: Prioritization Analysis (1 slide)
- In a world with limited resources, would you prioritize this technology for decarbonizing transportation over others? Why or why not?
- Compare it briefly to one other technology from the list. What makes your selected technology more or less impactful?


## Evaluation Criteria

Each category will be evaluated on a scale of 1 to 3:

| **Score** | **Description**                                                                 |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **3**     | Excellent: Clear, thorough, well-reasoned, and supported with evidence/analysis.|
| **2**     | Satisfactory: Adequate response but missing some depth, clarity, or evidence.   |
| **1**     | Needs Improvement: Incomplete, unclear, or lacks critical reasoning/evidence.   |

### Evaluation Categories

| **Category**                          | **Criteria for Evaluation**                                                                                                                                     |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Introduction of Technology**        | Is the technology clearly defined and explained? Does the group frame the problem using the Heilmeyer catechism effectively?                                    |
| **Climate Relevance**                 | Are both positive and negative impacts discussed thoughtfully? Are any quantitative estimates included to support their claims?                                 |
| **Leveraging the Technology**         | Are creative and realistic policy and technology-only solutions proposed? Are the proposed solutions well-justified and analyzed for potential emissions impact?|
| **Barriers and Mitigation Strategies**| Are the key barriers to adoption identified? Are the proposed strategies for overcoming these barriers realistic and specific?                                  |
| **Prioritization Analysis**           | Is the group’s reasoning for prioritizing this technology clear and well-argued? Is there a comparison to other technologies to justify their decision?          |
| **Presentation Quality**              | Are the slides clear, well-organized, and visually engaging? Is the group’s delivery confident, concise, and easy to follow?                                     |
