# Course grading breakdown

## Individual assignments (30%)

### Assignments:
1. Homework: Sankey diagram analysis (7%) - Turn in document + canvas post and comments
2. In-class: TEA analysis (7%) - Turn in document
3. Homework: Job search (8%) - 2-minute in-class presentation
4. In-class: LCA problem set (8%) - Turn in document
Percentages should sum to the Individual Assignments total percentage.

Each assignment is graded for:
1. Completeness: Attempts were made on every problem (50%)
2. Quality of answer: Numerical answers are in the right ballpark, qualitative answers make sound arguments (50%)

Rubric:
Unsatisfactory - 
Satisfactory - shows ability to pull in outside information
Exemplary - making arguments quantitative where possible, synthesizes and cites sources

## Group assignments (20%):
Each assignment is graded based on:
1. Completeness: Presentations were given on the material (50%)
2. Instructor Evaluation: I will assess presentation quality with a provided rubric (30%)
3. Peer Evaluation: Classmembers outside of your group will rate the quality of your presentation (15%)
4. Thoughtfulness of your provided evaluation feedback (5%)

We are trying to cover a lot of material in a short amount of time. We are relying on breakout groups to do "deep-dives" and distill the content for a larger audience.

Group sizes: 3-4 people will be assigned a group. I will be assigning groups to ensure a spread of majors and class years across groups.

### Assignments
1. Transportation vehicle-miles traveled solutions (10%) - 5-minute presentation + 5 minute questions
2. Net-zero report scenario presentations (10%) - 8-minute presentations + 2 minute questions
Percentages should sum to the Group Assignments total percentage.

## Group final project (40%):
Learning objective:
Propose a new climate technology solution, either in transportation, agriculture or carbon removal

Deliverable:
20 minute presentation + 10 minutes for questions

### Evaluation criteria
1. Is the problem / opportunity well-defined and quantified? (30%)
    - How is it done today?
2. Is the solution / technology clear? (30%)
    - What is being proposed?
    - How does this solve the problem?
3. Is the analysis of impact clear? Make clear what assumptions are made, why they are okay to make, etc.

4. What would it take to build this? Who is on your team? What risks will you face? How do you mitigate these?

## Class Participation (5%):
Grading for:
1. Attendance (2%)
2. Active class member, asks questions, raises issues (3%)

## Field-trip participation (5%)
Grading for:
1. Attendance (5%)
TODO: Need a make-up assignment  focused on ag. 

Other class thoughts:

Day 1 commentary:
- primarily here to drawdown GHGs which increase net-radiative forcing. Out-of-scope issues:
    - climate resilience, adaptation
    - habitat and biodiversity loss
    - other environmental pollutants (microplastics, groundwater pollution, etc.)
- need to address elephant in the room, incoming administration
    - number of people committed to climate action hasn't reduced
    - 4 years of business as usual makes things harder but can be overcome

- why energy geopolitics are back, how they play a factor, how we need to learn to roll with this
- why this course is part engineering part economics. energy is a commodity made cheap by large cap-ex investments. climate tech lives and dies by unit economics
- despite this, why we should still be pursuing far-reaching technologies
