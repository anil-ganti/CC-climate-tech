# Course grading breakdown

## Individual assignments (30%)

### Assignments:
1. Homework: Sankey diagram analysis (7%) - Turn in document + canvas post and comments
2. In-class: TEA analysis (7%) - Turn in document
3. Homework: Job search (8%) - 2-minute in-class presentation
4. In-class: LCA problem set (8%) - Turn in document
Percentages should sum to the Individual Assignments total percentage.

Each assignment is graded for:
1. Completeness: Attempts were made on every problem (50%)

2. Quality of answer: Numerical answers are in the right ballpark, qualitative answers make sound arguments (50%). Below is a general rubric for how quality will be assessed:
**Unsatisfactory** - Final numbers are orders of magnitude off or calculations have clear unit / dimensional errors in them.
**Satisfactory** - Numbers are reasonable, unit analysis is sound, more could have been done to support conclusions, either by citing sources, or making quantitative arguments where possible.
**Exemplary** - Final numbers look correct, unit analysis is clearly done right, sources are cited, open-ended questions are answered with quantitative arguments. Multiple sources of information are critically looked at (are these trust-worthy sources?), information is synthesized in a coherent way.

## Group assignments (20%):
Each assignment is graded based on:
1. Completeness: Presentations were given on the material (50%)
2. Instructor evaluation: I will assess presentation quality with a provided rubric (30%)
3. Received peer evaluation: Class members outside of your group will rate the quality of your presentation (15%)
4. Given peer evaluation: Thoughtfulness of your provided evaluation feedback (5%)

We are trying to cover a lot of material in a short amount of time. We are relying on breakout groups to do "deep-dives" and distill the content for a larger audience.

Group sizes: 3-4 people will be assigned a group. I will be assigning groups to ensure a spread of majors and class years across groups.

### Assignments
1. Transportation vehicle-miles traveled solutions (10%) - 5-minute presentation + 5 minute questions
2. Net-zero report scenario presentations (10%) - 8-minute presentations + 2 minute questions
Percentages should sum to the Group Assignments total percentage.

## Group final project (40%):
Learning objective:
Propose a new climate technology solution, either in transportation, agriculture or carbon removal

Deliverable:
20 minute presentation + 10 minutes for questions

### Evaluation criteria
1. Is the problem / opportunity well-defined and quantified? (30%)
    - How is it done today?
    - What is the overall market size?
    - What is the **addressable** market size?
2. Is the proposed solution / technology clear? (30%)
    - What is being proposed?
    - How does this solve the problem?
    - Is this approach quantifiably better than existing approaches?
    - If that isn't answerable, what analysis / research would need to be done to answer that question?
3. Is the analysis of impact clear? Make clear what assumptions are made, why they are okay to make, etc.
    - Taking either a bottom-up or top-down approach, can you quantify the potential impact (i.e. upper bound) of your solution?
    - What is a more realistic impact in the near (< 5 year), medium (10 year) and long (15+ year) term?
4. What would it take to build this? Who is on your team? What risks will you face? How do you mitigate these?
    - Did the group do a competetive landscape analysis? What other possible solutions are there to the problem, not necessarily today, but coming down the pipeline.
    - Does the group understand what it would take to build what is being proposed? What kinds of engineers do they need?
    - In the process of development, what kinds of risks do you foresee? Are there mitigation strategies that can let you get by while you figure out a long-term solution?
    - Identify where the core IP lies. i.e. what will you do that competitors won't easily be able to replicate?

## Class Participation (5%):
Grading for:
1. Attendance (2%)
2. Active class member, asks questions, raises issues (3%)

## Field-trip participation (5%)
Grading for:
1. Attendance (5%)
TODO: Need a make-up assignment  focused on ag. 

Other class thoughts:

Day 1 commentary:
- primarily here to drawdown GHGs which increase net-radiative forcing. Out-of-scope issues:
    - climate resilience, adaptation
    - habitat and biodiversity loss
    - other environmental pollutants (microplastics, groundwater pollution, etc.)
- need to address elephant in the room, incoming administration
    - number of people committed to climate action hasn't reduced
    - 4 years of business as usual makes things harder but can be overcome

- why energy geopolitics are back, how they play a factor, how we need to learn to roll with this
- why this course is part engineering part economics. energy is a commodity made cheap by large cap-ex investments. climate tech lives and dies by unit economics
- despite this, why we should still be pursuing far-reaching technologies
