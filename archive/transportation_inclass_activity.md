# Group Activity: Technology Impacts on Transportation Decarbonization

## Learning Objectives
Students will learn to do in-depth analysis of a particularly important emissions segment, transportation and learn to project current trends and evaluate their potential impact on decarbonization goals. Students will also learn to communicate these findings to their peers and lead discussion.

## Evaluation
Groups will be asked to give a short presentation the following day on their deep-dive. These slides should address the following:

- What is the decarbonization challenge you're focusing on? Quantify this in terms of energy / emissions. (start very high level)

- What is the current practice? How is this segment of transportation met today?

- What trend that is impacting this sector are you going to discuss in depth?

- Show some "new" analysis which makes projections about these trends.

- What opportunities or new challenges do these trends present in decarbonization efforts?

- What does the market landscape for this particular challenge look like?

# Group 1: Ride-Hailing Services and Autonomous Vehicles

## Overview
Analyze the impact of ride-hailing services (Uber, Lyft) on vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and CO₂ emissions. Consider how autonomous vehicles (AVs) might alter this in the future.

## Guiding Questions
- How has ride-hailing impacted VMT? What role does “dead-heading” (vehicles without passengers) play in increasing VMT?
- What are the lifecycle emissions impacts of ride-hailing, including vehicle production, use, and end-of-life?
- Has ride-hailing reduced car ownership? How much would car ownership need to decrease to result in significant emissions reductions?
- What impact would autonomous vehicles have on VMT, emissions, and car ownership rates?

## Original Analysis
- Estimate the percentage of ride-hailing trips that are “dead-head” miles and calculate the added emissions impact.
- Calculate the reduction in car ownership required to offset the increased VMT from ride-hailing.
- Research projections for how autonomous vehicles might reduce or increase VMT and emissions.

# Group 2: Micro-Mobility (E-Bikes, E-Scooters)

## Overview
Analyze how micro-mobility solutions, such as e-bikes and e-scooters, impact VMT and emissions, especially in urban environments.

## Guiding Questions
- How has the adoption of micro-mobility affected personal vehicle trips and VMT in cities?
- What are the lifecycle emissions for micro-mobility devices? Include manufacturing, energy consumption, and disposal.
- How much VMT reduction would be needed for micro-mobility to make a significant dent in transportation emissions?
- What role do e-bikes and e-scooters play in replacing short car trips, and what is the emissions savings from those replacements?

## Original Analysis
- Estimate the total number of vehicle miles that could be replaced by e-bikes or e-scooters in a typical city. Calculate the corresponding emissions reduction.
- Compare the lifecycle emissions of micro-mobility devices with that of a personal vehicle over the same distance traveled.

# Group 3: Carbon Fiber and Vehicle Lightweighting

## Overview
Explore how carbon fiber (CF) and other lightweight materials can reduce emissions by improving vehicle fuel efficiency. Analyze the barriers to widespread adoption of CF.

## Guiding Questions
- What is the potential reduction in fuel consumption and CO₂ emissions from vehicle lightweighting using carbon fiber?
- What technological and economic barriers are preventing mass adoption of carbon fiber in vehicles today?
- What advancements in carbon fiber production or recycling could unlock mass adoption for lightweighting?

## Original Analysis
- Calculate the potential fuel savings per 100 pounds of weight reduced in a typical passenger vehicle. Estimate the total emissions reduction if carbon fiber were widely adopted.
- Research the cost difference between manufacturing vehicles with carbon fiber vs. traditional materials. How much would the cost need to decrease to be viable?

# Group 5: Last-mile delivery

# Electric Vehicles (EVs) vs. Plug-In Hybrids (PHEVs)

## Overview
Conduct a lifecycle analysis (LCA) comparing EVs, plug-in hybrids (PHEVs), and internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. Focus on manufacturing, energy consumption, and end-of-life impacts.

## Guiding Questions
- What are the total lifecycle emissions of EVs compared to PHEVs and ICE vehicles? Include emissions from battery production, energy use, and disposal.
- How does the carbon intensity of the electricity grid affect the emissions savings of EVs vs. PHEVs?
- Which vehicle type has the best cost-to-emissions-savings ratio over its lifecycle?

## Original Analysis
- Compare the lifecycle emissions for each vehicle type, assuming different energy grid mixes (e.g., a clean grid vs. a fossil-fuel-heavy grid).
- Calculate the payback period for an EV and a PHEV in terms of emissions savings compared to ICE vehicles. How long before an EV breaks even on emissions from production?

# Hydrogen Fuel Cells for Heavy-Duty Transport

## Overview
Analyze the potential for hydrogen fuel cell technology to decarbonize heavy-duty transportation sectors, such as trucking, buses, or shipping.

## Guiding Questions
- What are the emissions savings from using hydrogen fuel cells compared to diesel in heavy-duty trucks or buses?
- What is the current cost of hydrogen fuel production, and how does it compare to diesel or battery-electric options?
- What infrastructure challenges (e.g., hydrogen refueling stations) must be overcome for mass adoption?

## Original Analysis
- Calculate the emissions savings of replacing diesel trucks with hydrogen fuel cell trucks on a per-mile basis.
- Estimate the costs of building hydrogen refueling infrastructure at scale.

## Guiding Questions
- What are the environmental impacts of EV battery production, and how does recycling mitigate these impacts?
- How effective are second-life battery applications (e.g., grid storage) at reducing emissions compared to producing new batteries?
- What are the technical challenges of scaling battery recycling and second-life uses?

## Original Analysis
- Estimate the emissions savings from using second-life batteries for grid storage compared to manufacturing new storage systems.
- Compare the lifecycle emissions of batteries with and without recycling processes.

# Smart Transportation and Traffic Management

## Overview
Analyze the potential emissions savings from smart transportation technologies, such as real-time traffic management systems, smart parking, and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication.

## Guiding Questions
- How do smart traffic management systems reduce congestion and VMT?
