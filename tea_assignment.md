# Techno-Economic Analysis Assignment
In this assignment we will walk through the basics of a techno-economic analysis (TEA) model. Engineering technology requires careful thought of the economics, particuarly when you are up against an incumbent industry that sells a cheap commodity. 
Great technology with bad economics (looking forward to production at volume) simply doesn't work in the energy space. We'll take a hypothetical company which seeks to produce and sell hydrogen from waste biomass. We'll look at their market and climate potential and assess.
Based on the techno-economics, we can make suggestion about where they could focus research and technology development efforts. While this is just a "toy model" version, the same basic ideas apply to much more complex technologies.
Deeper technical understanding of the technical area can produce very insightful TEA models that save companies millions of dollars and years of research.

## Learning objectives

- Learn what techno-economic analysis is and why it is so important for climate-tech

- Do a simple total addressable market analysis from top-down and also bottom-up

- Do a total cost of ownership calculation, green premium, and marginal cost of abatement

- Do a competetive analysis comparison? Skate to where the puck is going to be. Need to be competetive in tomorrow's landscape

- Evalulating impact of R&D. If we can do XX, that translates to YY

- Understanding cost curves? Reducing costs through material inputs vs economics of scale vs process innovation


## Techno-economic analysis overview and podcast
Start with looking through these [slides on TEA from the DOE](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2022-01/2022-01-19%20-%20Intro%20to%20TEA%20-%20Slides%20and%20Transcript_compliant_1_0.pdf)

### Question 1: What is TEA and why does it matter?
Explain in your own words what a techno-economic analysis is, and why it is so important in climate tech (3-4 sentences)

Now, listen to this [podcast](https://www.canarymedia.com/podcasts/catalyst-with-shayle-kann/climatetech-startups-need-strong-techno-economic-analysis). Note: I highly recommend listening to more episodes of this podcast to get a lay of the land in climate-tech.

Pause ~12:30 and answer these questions: 

### Question 2
What is capacity factor? Do a quick google search on the capacity factor of natural gas, nuclear, solar and wind. Record your numbers and explain what you are seeing.

### Question 3
What is levelized cost of energy (LCOE)? What is the LCOE of natural gas, nuclear, solar and wind? This will require a quick google search.

### Question 4
Suppose you are a new start-up developing some decarbonization technology which requires renewable electricity. Why should you / or should you not use LCOE in your techno-economic analysis? Why is capacity factor important in computing your input costs?

Continue to ~14:30, pause and answer the following question:

### Question 5
Dr. Greg Thiel talks about why trying to capture waste heat might sound very appealing, but may not pencil out economically. 
Suppose I have a chemical plant and had a source of waste heat which I am going to exhaust to the atmosphere through a long pipe. I am considering recycling that waste heat which will improve my energy efficiency. How will this affect my cap-ex and op-ex?

Continue and pause at ~19:30

### Question 6
When building a techno-economic model why might I want to use a future or "target" price as an input to my model instead of the current price? What does Dr. Greg Thiel suggest doing instead when modeling the price of your inputs?

He doesn't use this term, but what he is reffering to is a "green premium". Look at this [article on the green premium](https://www.breakthroughenergy.org/our-approach/the-green-premium/#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20Green%20Premium,that%20emits%20more%20greenhouse%20gases.) and explain in your own words what a green premium is.

Continue on the podcast to ~26:15

### Question 7
They talk about component costs vs system costs. Explain this in your own words, say, in the context of an electric vehicle.

### Question 8
They give two examples where systems-level thinking is important in your techno-economic analysis. In the first example, an ammonia reactor, they say that even large gains in efficiency may not matter, while in the second example, electric vehicles, they say that even small gains in efficiency can make a huge difference. Explain this in your own words.

### Question 9
Continue to ~30:30

Explain what they mean when they say that you shouldn't compare market price to your production cost. Suppose I have a new technology which will capture natural gas instead of flaring it from oil and gas wells (it's basically free!). Why would my production cost not be the right number?

### Question 10
Continue to ~35:30

Why is it not enough to compare your new technology to what is in the market today? What else do you need to do to have confidence that your technology will be competetive?

## Question 11: Green premiums, cost parity and a carbon price: a bottom-up analysis
We will try to reproduce the findings of a 2011 (old, I know) report from NREL on producing hydrogen from biomass.
Report can be found [here](https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/articles/hydrogen-production-cost-estimate-using-biomass-gasification-independent). I recommend looking through it as you work through this question.

### Key Data:
1. **Hydrogen Yield**: 75 kg of H₂ per dry ton (dt) of biomass.
2. **Feedstock Requirements**: 2000 dry tons of biomass per day for an "Nth plant."
3. **Feedstock Cost**: $80/dry ton of biomass.
4. **Energy Requirements**: 15 GJ per ton of hydrogen.
5. **Energy Cost**: $5/GJ (natural gas).
7. **Carbon Sequestration**: 2 tons of CO₂ per ton of hydrogen produced.
8. **Capital Expenditure (CapEx)**: $344 million for the Nth plant.
9. **Plant Lifetime** 30 years
10. **Plant Capacity Factor** 0.95 (unitless)

Your goal is to calculate the levelized hydrogen production cost ($/kg), assess the impact of carbon pricing, and reflect on the feasibility of the technology.

### Calculating OpEx input costs
1. Calculate the feedstock cost per kg of hydrogen produced.
2. Calculate the energy input cost per kg of hydrogen produced.
   
### Calculating levelized cost of hydrogen
1. Use the capital expenditure (CapEx) costs, the plant lifetime, and the plant capacity factor, or time the plant is running, to calculate the levelized cost of hydrogen production.
2. Suppose you want to run on cheap wind electricity. Use your capacity factor and LCOE of wind from question 3 to calculate what your levelized cost of hydrogen would be if you produced hydrogen only when the wind was blowing.

### Scenario analysis
Typically a TEA will include sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis. Qualitatively, what would need to change to bring down your levelized cost of hydrogen production? How does this map to ongoing trends in the energy landscape?
