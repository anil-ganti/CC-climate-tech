# Techno-Economic Analysis Assignment
In this assignment we will walk through the basics of a techno-economic analysis (TEA) model. Engineering technology requires careful thought of the economics, particuarly when you are up against an incumbent industry that sells a cheap commodity. 
Great technology with bad economics (looking forward to production at volume) simply doesn't work in the energy space. We'll take a hypothetical hydrogen truck company and look at their market and climate potential.
Based on the techno-economics, we can make suggestion about where they could focus research and technology development efforts. While this is just a "toy model" version, the same basic ideas apply to much more complex technologies.
Deeper technical understanding of the technical area can produce very insightful TEA models that save companies millions of dollars and years of research.

## Learning objectives

- Do a simple total addressable market analysis from top-down and also bottom-up

- Do a total cost of ownership calculation, green premium, and marginal cost of abatement

- Do a competetive analysis comparison? Skate to where the puck is going to be. Need to be competetive in tomorrow's landscape

- Evalulating impact of R&D. If we can do XX, that translates to YY

- Understanding cost curves? Reducing costs through material inputs vs economics of scale vs process innovation

## Question 1: Compute the total addressable market: a top-down analysis

- Estimate the total addressable market for hydrogen in heavy-duty trucking
 
- Repeat this for light-duty trucking

- In both heavy-duty and light-duty sectors, what competing carbon-free technologies might you need to compete with?

- Competetive analysis: Find existing companies working in this space.

- Market landscape:

## Question 2: Calculating "green premium" and finding cost parity: a bottom-up analysis

Using current prices:

- What is total operating cost of a diesel truck?

- Total operating cost of a hydrogen truck using your technology?

- What is the "green premium" that a truck owner pays? Ignoring embodied emissions, operating a diesel truck emits how much CO2, versus hydrogen truck? What would the cost of carbon need to be to cover this premium? How does this compare to current costs in the voluntary carbon market?

- Assume diesel prices hold steady, what does price of hydrogen need to be to hit parity?

- At cost parity, what percent of the TCO is the up-front cost?

Suppose your head of R&D comes to you and suggests a line of research which would increase the up-front cost by XX, but improve efficiency by YY. Compute what this does to total cost of ownership.
