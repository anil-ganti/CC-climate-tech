# 1/10 Day 5 Agenda
I will again be out this day but we will have either a pre-recorded lecture from me or a live guest lecture. The remainder of the day will be a group working day to put together project proposals 

## Final Group Project
Your group will be asked to develop a pitch deck for a new climate technology solution. This could be anything ranging from a new smartphone app which reduces personal vehicle miles, to a new aquaponics farm, to a new way to remove and store atmospheric carbon.


If successful students will demonstrate the ability to:

- answer the "heilmeyer questions" in a clear, direct manner
- support their arguments with "gut-check" back-of-the-envelope calculations using dimensional analysis
- clearly lay out any assumptions they are making, and be able to support those assumptions
- appropriately synthesize and build upon data / analyses from trusted sources
- quantify potential climate impacts (GHG emission reductions or GHG removal) and other potential "co-benefits"

Deliverable:
20 minute presentation + 10 minutes for questions


## Group Assignment

Submit a no more than 1-page document with 2-3 potential project ideas. Also include a half-page documenting your group's ideation and selection process.

## Evaluation

Proposals evaluated for completeness and thoughtful-ness. Process documents will be graded for completeness.
