# Lifecycle analysis (LCA)

## Learning objectives
- understand GWP, and CO2e for comparing climate impacts of different GHGs
- understand the concept of "upstream emissions" and how to attribute climate impact of products / technologies
- understand how product use matters and how there may not be a one-size fits all approach to decarbonization

If you haven't already, go through these [videos](https://www.energy.gov/eere/iedo/life-cycle-assessment-and-techno-economic-analysis-training#LCA)

Read through this [document](https://www.edf.org/sites/default/files/content/emission_equivalency_tool_documentation_methodology_23062022.pdf) on GHG emissions equivalency and the basics of GHG accounting for comparing products and processes which may emit multiple or different GHGs.

## Question 1
In your own words, what does the unit ton CO2e represent? What is GWP20 versus GWP100? Based on the values in the first table and in the first row GWP20 for methane is much higher than it's GWP100. What does that tell you about the lifetime of methane in the atmosphere relative to CO2?

## Question 2
The document states that, "On average, the life cycle of 1 kg of beef emits 4.5 kg of CO2, 1.3 kg of methane, and 0.02 kg of N2O". Using the GWP100 values, compute the total ton CO2e for 1kg of beef. Can you describe the likely sources of the CO2, methane, and N2O attributable to beef production? This may take a quick google search. Record your findings and include sources.

Now look through this [document](https://www.catf.us/resource/analysis-lifecycle-greenhouse-gas-emissions-natural-gas-coal/) on GHG emissions associated with natural gas and coal.

## Question 3
Looking at Figure 3, explain what upstream methane is referring to for power production. What are the sources of variation of upstream methane and upstream CO2?

## Question 4
Suppose I have a technology which burns natural gas for power production, captures and sequesters the CO2 with virtually zero leakage. Would this technology be net-zero emissions? Why or why not? How would fuel sourcing matter in calculating the GHG emissions associated with my technology?

Now let's look at LCA as it applies to electric vehicles. Explore the [IEA Electric Vehicle LCA calculator](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-tools/ev-life-cycle-assessment-calculator). Click on the "View a walkthrough of this tool" button, go through the pages and answer the following question:

## Question 5
What determines the y-intercept of the cumulative emissions curves? What determines the slope?

## Question 6
Now play with the tool for 5-10 minutes and record 2-3 interesting observations you have. Explain how / why product end-use matters in determining lifecycle emissions.
