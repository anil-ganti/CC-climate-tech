# Colorado College PC271 - Investigations in Climate Technology
Welcome to PC271! This half-block course offers students a foundational understanding of the critical needs and opportunities in climate technology. The course begins by exploring the emissions reductions required to limit global temperature rise to 1.5Â°C and the unprecedented efforts necessary to achieve this target. Students will be introduced to emerging climate technologies across various sectors while engaging in open discussions on hotly debated topics within the field. Additionally, the course will introduce students to analytical frameworks commonly used in evaluating new technical concepts and addressing global-scale challenges. By the end of the course, students will gain valuable insights into how studying the physical sciences and engineering can contribute to mitigating the worst impacts of climate change. The course is open to all Colorado College students, regardless of their major.

## Graded Assignments ##
Multiple group presentations plus a final project which will involve expanding on a previous in-class design / analysis presentation.

## Course Outline / Syllabus
### 1/6 Day 1: How bad is it? What do we need to do?

We will look at some key figures in the 2021, 2022, and 2023 IPPC reports to understand the physical science basis for why we need to act fast. We'll also do a quick lesson on unit analysis, and the units relevant in energy / climate.

**Learning Objectives** Get a grasp on the trends in climate science, learn to apply basic unit analysis to estimating magnitude, learn to read and analyze Sankey flow diagrams.

**Key take-away:** Every 0.5 C that we can mitigate is huge. This should give us a sense of hope and motivate action. **This class is not for doomers!**

**In-class activity / discussion:** Pick one figure from one of the IPCC reports that you want to discuss, or you found interesting and explain it.

**Guest Lecture:** Dr. Jen Schafer, ARPA-E program director and professor at Colorado School of Mines on nuclear fission energy, past, present, and future.

**Invidiual HW Assignment** See [Sankey Diagram assignment](sankey_activity.md)

### 1/7 Day 2: Decarbonizing Transportation
Transportation makes up ~20 - 25% of global CO2 emissions, closer to 33% in the US. We'll look at what it will take to decarbonize transportation.

**Learning Objectives** Get an overview of why transportation decarbonization is both important and challenging, learn to quantify potential impact of technologies using simple techno-economic analysis methods.

**Group Assignment** Group deep dives on parts of the transportation sector to be presented the following day. See [Transportation in-class group activity](transportation_inclass_activity.md)

**Potential final project ideas** Proposals to reduce vehicle-miles traveled (VMT) with technology-only solutions. See [Transportation assignment](transportation_activity.md)

### 1/8 Day 3: Decarbonizing Electricity
Electricity production is the next largest sector at 25% of total CO2 emissions in the US. We'll look at currently available technologies and the technical, economic, and social barriers to adoption. 

**In-class activity / dicussion** Dicussion on permitting, NIMBYism, etc. Are there any technical solutions to these problems?

**Guest Lecture** Dr. Tyler Ruggles on Decarbonizing the Electricity System

**HW Assignment** Net-zero America scenario analysis. Break out into groups, each will dive deep into a different NZ scenario. Present the scenario, look for the critical technology gaps, opportunities, etc. See [Net-Zero scenario assignment](netzero_activity.md)

### 1/9 Day 4: Next Generation Electricity Production
Now we'll start looking at the potentially game-changing technical breakthroughs that would shake-up what we've talked about so far. This will inclucde a brief intro to next-gen energy storage, fusion energy, and natural hydrogen.

**In-class activity** Group presentations from yesterday's assignment on net-zero America.

**Guest Lecture** Sam Wurzel, former ARPA-E adviser in fusion, founder of FusionEnergyBase on "Why Fusion Energy Will Change Everything"

**HW Assignment** Answering the Heilmeyer questions on new technical concepts. Doing some example techno-economic analysis.

### 1/10 Day 5: Agriculture
Agricultural emissions are notoriously difficult to abate because they are happening over vast areas of land. We'll talk about soil carbon stocks, methane and nitroux oxide emissions and how to reduce them.
**In-class Activity** Presentations from HW assignment. 
**HW Assignment** In groups, pick an ag-tech technology and make a pitch for it. Examples may include vertical farms, large-scale aquaculture, fake meats, etc. Answer the Heilmeyer questions and estimate potential impact. What are the risks? How will you get people to adopt?

### 1/13 Day 6: Hard-to-decarbonize sectors: Industry
The "final" 8% emissions come from sectors we never really "see". Cement, iron, steel, etc. The building blocks of our built-environment require carbon to be emitted, not just for the heat, but to complete necessary chemical reactions.

**In-class activity** A discussion on buiding materials and circularity.

**Guest Lecture** Dr. Rakesh Radhakrishnan, former ARPA-E tech-to-market adviser, current climate-tech VC on the life-cycle of climate-tech start-ups and what you should know before joining one

**HW Assignment** Find and analyze a climate-tech job posting you find interesting. See [Job Assignment](career_activity.md) 

### Day 7: FIELD DAY
Trip up to Fort Collins to see AtmosZero and (hopefully) Charm Industrial. We will be leaving bright and early for a full day!

### Day 8: Negative Emissions - Carbon Dioxide Removal
Even if we hit net-zero "in-time", we still need negative emissions to maintain our targets of either 1.5 or more realistically, 2 C.

### Day 9: Adaptation, Resilience, Geoengineering
Given that we are seeing effects of climate change today, there is a growing space of climate resilience / adaptation technologies.

## Other assignments planned
1. Find an engineering / scientist role at a climate-tech start-up that you're interested in and present the job requisition. How would you get there from here today?
2. Students will make a LinkedIn, sign up for ClimateBase, WorkOnClimate and make a mock career plan
3. Climate-adjacent technology sectors. Students will look at adjacent technology sectors, evaluate their potential impact on climate tech. Examples include advanced materials, space-based earth observation, autonomous vehicles, biotech, etc.
