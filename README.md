# CC-climate-tech
Course notes, outline, etc for Colorado College climate tech engineering course

## Course Outline
Lectures:
### Lecture 1: How bad is it? What do we need to do?
Start with boiler plate slides on what we need to hit 1.5 C
Aside on model uncertainty
Where are we currently at? Look at Sankey diagram
#### Activity / Discussion
Look at energy and carbon sankey diagrams.

### Lecture 2: Decarbonization Pathways: Deploy, Deploy, Deploy
Quick intro on the technologies we have available to us today and some of the challenges
#### Activity: Net-Zero Report Summary
Break out into groups, each will dive deep into each NZ scenario. Present the scenario, look for the critical technology gaps, opportunities, etc.

### Lecture 3: Nuclear Renaissance


#### Activity: Jigsaw Format "Expert Groups"
Break out into groups, 1 group that says "no nuclear needed", one that argues why nuclear is absolutely needed, and some groups that research specific technologies, come back with the estimated impact on net-zero.
