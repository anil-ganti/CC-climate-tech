# Colorado College PC210 - Investigations in Climate Technology
Welcome to PC210! This half-block course offers students a foundational understanding of the critical needs and opportunities in climate technology. The course begins by exploring the emissions reductions required to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C and the unprecedented efforts necessary to achieve this target. Students will be introduced to emerging climate technologies across various sectors while engaging in open discussions on hotly debated topics within the field. Additionally, the course will introduce students to analytical frameworks commonly used in evaluating new technical concepts and addressing global-scale challenges. By the end of the course, students will gain valuable insights into how studying the physical sciences and engineering can contribute to mitigating the worst impacts of climate change. The course is open to all Colorado College students, regardless of their major.


## Course Outline / Syllabus
### 1/6 Day 1: How bad is it? What do we need to do?

We will look at some key figures in the 2021, 2022, and 2023 IPPC reports to understand the physical science basis for why we need to act fast. We'll also do a quick lesson on unit analysis, and the units relevant in energy / climate.

**Learning Objectives** Get a grasp on the trends in climate science, learn to apply basic unit analysis to estimating magnitude, learn to read and analyze Sankey flow diagrams.

**Key take-away:** Every 0.5 C that we can mitigate is huge. This should give us a sense of hope and motivate action. **This class is not for doomers!**

**In-class activity / discussion:** Ask a question that you would like answered by the end of the course. We will go through each question, group them and post them.

**Guest Lecture:** Dr. Jen Schafer, ARPA-E program director and professor at Colorado School of Mines on nuclear fission energy, past, present, and future.

### 1/7 Day 2: Decarbonizing Transportation
Transportation makes up ~20 - 25% of global CO2 emissions, closer to 33% in the US. We'll look at what it will take to decarbonize transportation.

**Learning Objectives** Get an overview of why transportation decarbonization is both important and challenging, learn to quantify potential impact of technologies using simple techno-economic analysis methods.

**In-class Individual Assignment** Example TEA analysis of a hypothetical company which produces hydrogen from waste biomass. Working in groups is encouraged, but individual answers must be turned in! See [TEA assignment](tea_assignment.md)

**Group brainstorm and presentation** Analyses of trends in transportation and their effect on climate goals. See [Transportation assignment](transportation_group_assignment.md)

### 1/8 Day 3: Decarbonizing Electricity - Double Session!
Electricity production is the next largest sector at 25% of total CO2 emissions in the US. We'll look at currently available technologies and the technical, economic, and social barriers to adoption. 

#### Morning session
**Guest Lecture** Dr. Tyler Ruggles on Decarbonizing the Electricity System

**In-class Assignment** Net-zero America scenario analysis. Break out into groups, each will dive deep into a different NZ scenario. Present the scenario, look for the critical technology gaps, opportunities, etc. See [Net-Zero scenario assignment](netzero_group_assignment.md)

#### Afternoon session
Group presentations - 15 minute presentations + 5 minutes for questions / discussion

### 1/9 Day 4: Next Generation Electricity Production - Anil Remote
Now we'll start looking at the potentially game-changing technical breakthroughs that would shake-up what we've talked about so far. This will inclucde a brief intro to next-gen energy storage, fusion energy, and natural hydrogen.

**Guest Lecture** Sam Wurzel, former ARPA-E adviser in fusion, founder of FusionEnergyBase on "Why Fusion Energy Will Change Everything"

**Guest Lecture** Emily Yedinak, materials scientist, currently at Koloma, a geologic hydrogen startup company speaking on geologic hydrogen

**Guest Lecture** Adrienne Little, mechanical engineer, currently at AtmosZero, previously at Antora, speaking on long-duration energy storage

**Individual HW Assignment** Quick intro to LCA analysis. See [LCA assignment](LCA_assignment.md)

### 1/10 Day 5: Agriculture - Anil Remote
Agricultural emissions are notoriously difficult to abate because they are happening over vast areas of land. We'll talk about soil carbon stocks, methane and nitroux oxide emissions and how to reduce them.

**Guest lecture / pre-recorded lecture**

**Working Session** In groups, start forming a project proposal Answer the Heilmeyer questions and estimate potential impact. What are the risks? How will you get people to adopt?

**Assignment - Project proposals due at 5pm Friday** - Must be submitted on time so I can get feedback to you ASAP and we can finalize proposals by Monday

### 1/13 Day 6: Hard-to-decarbonize sectors: Industry
The "final" 8% emissions come from sectors we never really "see". Cement, iron, steel, etc. The building blocks of our built-environment require carbon to be emitted, not just for the heat, but to complete necessary chemical reactions.

**In-class activity** A discussion on buiding materials and circularity.

**Guest Lecture** Dr. Rakesh Radhakrishnan, former ARPA-E tech-to-market adviser, current climate-tech VC on the life-cycle of climate-tech start-ups and what you should know before joining one

**HW Assignment** Find and analyze a climate-tech job posting you find interesting. See [Job Assignment](career_assignment.md) 

### Day 7: FIELD DAY
Trip up to Fort Collins to see Colorado State University's AgNext facility and AtmosZero.

### Day 8: Negative Emissions - Carbon Dioxide Removal
Even if we hit net-zero "in-time", we still need negative emissions to maintain our targets of 2 C.

### Day 9: Adaptation, Resilience, Geoengineering
Given that we are seeing effects of climate change today, there is a growing space of climate resilience / adaptation technologies.

## Additional Resources

### Podcasts
In my opinion this is the easiest (and therefore best) way to get an overview in the many different areas of climate science, policy and tech. While you're driving, running, gardening, etc, sneak these in whenever you can and you'll be pretty well versed in the basics.
